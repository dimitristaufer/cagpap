# CAGPAP Client

Browser-only Conference Agenda Generator for your PAPers.

## Current State

- Input sources:
  - PDFs (text extracted locally with `pdfjs-dist`)
  - OpenAlex author lookup -> selectable profile abstracts
  - Manual keywords
- Inputs can be combined in a single run.
- Matching modes:
  - `tfidf`
  - `semantic`
  - `hybrid`
- Semantic/hybrid scoring runs in a Web Worker with `@huggingface/transformers`.
- Semantic mode supports:
  - bundled local model files under `public/models/...`
  - in-browser model download/cache from the UI
- Conference scope can target the selected conference or search across all bundled conferences.
- Worker uses precomputed semantic schedule vectors first and falls back to local runtime embedding only if needed.
- Results include relevance scores, mode labeling, and `.ics` calendar export buttons.
